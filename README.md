# Snake Game Project Documentation

## Overview

This project is a classic Snake game implemented in Python. The player controls a snake, navigating it around the screen to collect items, grow in length, and avoid obstacles and self-collision.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pygame` library

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository or download the ZIP file**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   or download and extract the ZIP file.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd snake-final
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Usage

To run the game, execute the `main.py` file:

```sh
python main.py
```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The entry point of the game. It initializes the game and handles the main game loop.
- `config.py`: Contains configuration settings for the game, such as screen size, colors, and game speed.
- `game.py`: Manages the game state, including game initialization, updates, and drawing the game screen.
- `snake.py`: Defines the `Snake` class, handling the snake's movement, growth, and collision detection.
- `items.py`: Manages game items such as food that the snake can collect.
- `render.py`: Handles rendering of game objects and the user interface.
- `images`: Directory containing image assets used in the game.
- `sounds`: Directory containing sound assets used in the game.

## Code Explanation

### main.py

The `main.py` file contains the main game loop, initializing the game, and handling events such as user input and game updates.

### config.py

The `config.py` file contains various configuration settings for the game, such as screen dimensions, colors, and game speed.

### game.py

The `game.py` file manages the overall game state, including game initialization, updating game logic, and rendering the game screen.

### snake.py

The `snake.py` file defines the `Snake` class, which includes methods for moving the snake, growing the snake when it eats food, and detecting collisions.

### items.py

The `items.py` file manages game items such as food, including their placement on the game screen and interactions with the snake.

### render.py

The `render.py` file handles the rendering of game objects and the user interface, ensuring everything is drawn correctly on the screen.

## Dependencies

- `pygame`: A set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries.

## Future Improvements

- Adding more levels with increasing difficulty.
- Introducing new types of items with different effects.
- Implementing a scoring system and a high-score leaderboard.
- Enhancing graphics and sound effects.

## Conclusion

This Snake game project demonstrates basic game development principles using Python and Pygame. Feel free to explore the code, make modifications, and add new features to enhance the game.
